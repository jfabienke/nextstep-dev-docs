## High-Value Research Opportunities

### 1. Interface Builder Origins

Jean-Marie Hullot created Interface Builder *before* joining NeXT (1986), based on his "SOS Interface" concept from INRIA.

**Questions:**
- What was SOS Interface?
- How did Jobs discover Hullot's work?
- How did IB evolve from prototype to shipping product?

**Likely sources:** CHM may have Hullot oral history, French computing archives (INRIA)

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

### 2. The DSP Decision

NeXT was revolutionary in including a Motorola 56001 DSP for real-time audio.

**Questions:**
- Who championed including a DSP in a workstation?
- Who wrote the Music Kit and Sound Kit?
- Why did this capability disappear in the transition to Intel/Apple?

**Connection to existing research:** Rich Page's hardware decisions

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

### 3. Tim Berners-Lee and WorldWideWeb.app

The first web browser was written on a NeXTcube at CERN (1990).

**Questions:**
- Why did TBL choose NeXT specifically?
- What NeXTSTEP features made browser development faster?
- Did any NeXT engineers assist or advise?

**Likely sources:** CERN archives, TBL's own writings, CHM oral history

**Difficulty:** Easy — TBL has discussed this publicly

---

### 4. The Software Pivot (1993)

NeXT's decision to exit hardware and become a software company.

**Questions:**
- Who advocated for staying in hardware vs. going software-only?
- What was Rich Page's position before he left?
- How did the team react to abandoning the hardware they'd built?

**Connection to existing research:** Rich Page's departure (1992), Tevanian's software focus

**Difficulty:** Hard — involves private board discussions

---

### 5. Objective-C Evolution at NeXT

Steve Naroff adapted Stepstone's Objective-C for NeXT.

**Questions:**
- What specific changes did NeXT make to the language?
- Who invented "categories"?
- How did the GCC integration work?

**Likely sources:** Steve Naroff CHM oral history (102717385), GCC commit history

**Difficulty:** Easy — Naroff oral history exists

---

### 6. The Canon Partnership

Canon invested $100M in NeXT (1989).

**Questions:**
- What did Canon get in return?
- Did Canon engineers work on NeXT products?
- Why did the partnership eventually fade?

**Likely sources:** May require Japanese sources, business press archives

**Difficulty:** Hard — corporate partnership details often private

---

### 7. Keith Ohlfs: The Visual Identity

Ohlfs created NeXT's distinctive look — the logo, icons, UI aesthetic.

**Questions:**
- What was his background?
- How did he create the "Mathematica look" icons?
- Did he write code or just design?

**Connection to existing research:** Listed in Tevanian's team, but role described as "Illustrator/Programmer"

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

### 8. NeXT Ports to Other Architectures

NeXTSTEP ran on m68k, Intel 486, PA-RISC, and SPARC.

**Questions:**
- Who led each port?
- What were the technical challenges?
- Why was PA-RISC chosen (HP partnership)?

**Likely sources:** NeXTWORLD archives, HP partnership announcements, release notes

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

### 9. id Software and NeXT

John Carmack developed DOOM, Wolfenstein 3D, and Quake on NeXT hardware.

**Questions:**
- What NeXTSTEP features did id Software use?
- Did Carmack ever interact with NeXT engineers?
- Why did id eventually move away from NeXT?

**Likely sources:** Masters of Doom book, Carmack's .plan files, Game Engine Black Book series

**Difficulty:** Easy — Carmack has written extensively

---

### 10. The Automated Factory

NeXT's Fremont factory was highly automated with robots.

**Questions:**
- Who designed the manufacturing process?
- Was it actually cost-effective?
- What happened to the equipment when hardware was discontinued?

**Connection to existing research:** Rich Page oral history Part 2 mentions factory

**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard

## Summary by Difficulty

### Quick Wins (Likely Answerable)

| Topic | Why It's Tractable |
|-------|-------------------|
| Tim Berners-Lee | Well-documented, TBL is accessible |
| id Software/DOOM | Carmack has written extensively |
| Steve Naroff/Objective-C | CHM oral history exists |
| Interface Builder | Hullot's work is referenced in multiple sources |

### Medium Difficulty

| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| DSP/Music Kit | May require finding audio engineers |
| Keith Ohlfs | Limited public presence |
| Architecture ports | Technical details in release notes |
| Automated factory | Some coverage in Page oral history |

### Harder (But Fascinating)

| Topic | Why It's Difficult |
|-------|-------------------|
| Canon partnership | Japanese corporate records |
| Software pivot decision | Private board discussions |
