### MemoryManagementArchitects.md

**Question:** Who designed NeXT's retain/release/autorelease memory management system?

**Answer:** A collaborative effort led by:
- **Blaine Garst** — Primary architect of reference counting
- **Bertrand Serlet** — Leader of Foundation framework effort
- **Ali Ozer** — Co-author of Foundation classes
- **Trey Matteson** — Co-inventor on autorelease patent

## Methodology

Research in this directory draws from:
- **Computer History Museum oral histories** — First-person accounts from NeXT engineers
- **Patent records** — Technical documentation with inventor attribution
- **Contemporary documentation** — The NeXTSTEP 3.3 Developer Documentation itself
- **Secondary sources** — Technical histories and retrospectives

The goal is to connect the "what" (the documentation we're preserving) with the "who" and "why" (the people and decisions that created it).
