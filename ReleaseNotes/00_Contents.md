# 3.3 Developer Release Notes: Contents

**Release 3.3** — Copyright ©1995 by NeXT Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

With each release of its software, NeXT provides release notes containing information about the release. These notes apply to Release 3.3.

Release 3.3 is primarily a user release with few changes to Developer software. Consequently, most release notes contain sections describing features of the 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 releases.

The various files containing release notes for developers are listed below. These files are included in the "Developer Release Notes" target of the NEXTSTEP Developer bookshelf (in the directory `/NextLibrary/Bookshelves`), and are located in `/NextLibrary/Documentation/NextDev/ReleaseNotes`.

> **Note:** Information that would be useful for users and administrators has been moved to the administrator release notes, which has a target on the System Administation bookshelf. These developer release notes have been moved:
>
> - `Printing.rtf` — Printing software and printer support
> - `SndCmds.rtf` — Sound commands
> - `Terminal.rtf` — The Terminal application
>
> These developer release notes have had material removed and added to the System Administration notes:
>
> - `AppKit.rtf` — User-visibile changes to the Application Kit (named `AppBehavior.rtf` in Adminstration release notes)
> - `Edit.rtf` — The Edit application
> - `OperatingSystem.rtf` — Operating System software
> - `Workspace.rtf` — User-visibile changes to the NEXTSTEP Workspace Manager
