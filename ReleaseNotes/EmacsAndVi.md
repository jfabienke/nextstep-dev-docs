## Bugs Fixed in Release 3.2

| Reference | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| 33176 | **Emacs and vi didn't work in console mode on Intel platforms.** |
| | **Description:** When you used the console on an Intel-architecture machine (by typing "console" at the login window), you couldn't use emacs or vi to edit files. This has been corrected. |
