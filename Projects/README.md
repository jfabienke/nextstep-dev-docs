### PROJECT_RustBrowser.md
An exploratory analysis examining whether modern Rust tooling and crates could be leveraged to build a web browser for NeXTSTEP 3.3. This document explores:

- **Feasibility assessment**: Could Rust (with m68k LLVM backend) run on NeXTSTEP?
- **Ecosystem analysis**: Which Rust crates (http clients, HTML parsers, image decoders) could help?
- **Architecture design**: How would Rust core code integrate with Objective-C AppKit?
- **Comparative analysis**: Rust vs pure Objective-C implementation effort
- **Historical context**: Why Tim Berners-Lee's WorldWideWeb (1991) browser worked on NeXTSTEP

This is a **thought experiment** combining modern language features with vintage platform constraints. The analysis demonstrates how contemporary tools might theoretically approach problems that developers solved in 1994 using period-appropriate technologies.

**Note:** These are academic exercises in retrocomputing and software archaeology, not active development projects.
