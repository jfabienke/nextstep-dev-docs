## Historical Note

This chapter documented Interface Builder for NeXTSTEP Release 3.3. Interface Builder was the graphical development tool for constructing NeXTSTEP applications, allowing developers to:

- Visually design user interfaces by placing and configuring objects from palettes
- Establish connections between interface objects and controller objects
- Archive interface objects for loading at application runtime
- Set object attributes and properties through a graphical interface

For detailed information on how Interface Builder works and how to use it effectively in NeXTSTEP application development, refer to the current documentation referenced above.
